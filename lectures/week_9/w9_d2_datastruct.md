##  What are Data Types?
You guys should know this by now.
- Primative, Composite, ADT

1. Give an example of Primative

2. Composite Data Types:
    1. Think of the word 'composite'
    2. Just a combination of primative datatypes
    3. Combined, they form a singular composite DT.

3. Abstract Data Types:
    1. Simply, "Objects" (or classes)
    2. Custom objects built to do a job
    3. Mostly in the form of "containers"

ADT's are the foundation for OOP and object manipulation

## Data Structures
1. A set of ADT's that each serve specific purposes
2. Most are implemented natively, or in standard libraries
3. Foundational - manage the underlying flow and structure of programs
